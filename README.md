# ThreatOn-Json-Maker
Create ThreatON simulations in the accepted .json format with ease. Files are saved to the repository folder.
This is a node js application that uses electron to intialize, therefore both must be downloaded for runnability.  
To run via the terminal:  
`cd Documents/GitHub/ThreatOn-Json-Maker`  
`npm install`  
`npm start`
## More on the format
The files are named using a UUID (Universal Unique Identifier). These numbers identify and distinguish internet entities and objects. As such, it is extremely unlikely for there to be duplicate UUIDS, ensuring that the files are easily identified.

UUIDs can be found/generated here: https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version4
